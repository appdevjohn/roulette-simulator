# Roulette Simulator

Simulates roulette games until the strategy fails. Right now, the strategy being used 
is the Martingale system. The strategy fails when the bet required to make up a loss 
exceeds the balance of the player.

## Running on your machine.

1. Ensure Python is installed on your local machine.
2. Run `python roulette-simulator.py` in the script's directory.

## Sample Output

The sample output reflects scenarios where the min bet is $5, the max bet is $5000, and 
the player starts with $500.
